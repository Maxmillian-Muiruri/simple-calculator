- Buttons to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Displays the result dynamically.
- Professional styling with background, borders, and rounded corners.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Enter two numbers in the input fields.
3. Click one of the operation buttons (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide).
4. The result will be displayed below the buttons.
